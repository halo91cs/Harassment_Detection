Multi modal dataset for the purpose of detecting toxic behavior on social media

<p>Ultimate goal of this project is detection of toxic behavior on Twitter social media for high school students. We introduce a novel approach that adopts interaction-based analysis in which we investigate toxic interactions rather than individual tweets. Because we believe that individual tweets do not provide enough evidence for toxic behavior, hence aggregating tweets for each interaction provides us a context to make a determination.</p>

<p>In addition to interaction-level analysis we also adopt multi-modal analysis meaning we not only analyze tweets but also images & emojis in the interactions to increase the detection accuracy. </p>

<p>This dataset will enable researchers to capture the context in social media interactions rather than individual tweets. It provides rich multimodal data and metadata that will help have a better understanding of online toxicity. </p>

<p>Source files such as tweets metadata, and lexicon aren't shared because of privacy purposes.</p>

<p>This repository gives how data transformation phaase work, what type of data processing been made, how interactions been extracted, how tweets been aggregated, image processing, emoji extraction and many more </p>

<p>data_config.json file is the config file where we store all data sources' path along with credentials and output files' paths </p>
